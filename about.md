I am a PhD student at McGill University in the [Reasoning and Learning
Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca).  I spent some time during my [master's
thesis](https://github.com/pierrelux/skill-acquisition) thinking about the
so-called "options" in [reinforcement
learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning). My main
question was (and still remains): how would an agent automatically acquire a
set of skills from the interaction with its environment ?

More generally, I'll be glad to hear about anything which has to do with
learning modular (whatever that means) probabilistic systems. These days, I
have a tendency to fall into the disguised procastination pattern of reading
infinitely on some of these topics: formal power series, noncommutative
harmonic analysis, exchangeable sequences and mixture models, the
information-theory-universial-coding thread, attention and human skills
acquisition, the
[relation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901116/) of grammar in
natural language to motor control. This is a big disorganized soup of concepts
at the moment, but I have hope in making something sensical out of it at some point.

Concretely, I have worked so far on [reinforcement
learning](http://staff.vbi.vt.edu/swarup/main/papers/main2013_paper02.pdf) and
spectral learning of stochastic automata (in review).

In an attempt to organize my thoughts, I sometimes try to write short notes on
this blog: a modern interpretation of the
[commonplaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). I also have a
set of IPython Notebooks available on
[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pierrelux/notebooks/tree/master/).
