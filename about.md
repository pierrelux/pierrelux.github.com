I am a PhD student at McGill University in the [Reasoning and Learning
Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca).  I spent some time during my [master's
thesis](https://github.com/pierrelux/masters-thesis) thinking about the
so-called "options" in [reinforcement
learning](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning). My main
question was (and still remains): how would an agent automatically acquire a
set of skills from the interaction with its environment ?

In an attempt to organize my thoughts, I sometimes try to write short notes on
this blog: a modern interpretation of the
[commonplaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). I also have a
set of IPython Notebooks available on
[Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pierrelux/notebooks/tree/master/).
