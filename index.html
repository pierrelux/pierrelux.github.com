      <p>They say that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I have to admit: my hammer for Hierachical Reinforcement Learning is the options framework of Sutton, Precup &#38; Singh (1999). While reading Ali, Othchy, Pehlevan, Fantana, Burak &#38; Ölveczky (2013) about motor skills learning of birdsong, I couldn’t keep myself from contemplating the ressemblance to the options model. The results presented in this month edition of Neuron showed the existence...</p>

      <p>Recent work by Daniel, Neumann &#38; Peters (2012) as well as similar independent research by Thomas &#38; Barto (2012) has started to make me think that we might benefit from revisiting the classical HRL model. Under the perpective taken by these authors, hiearchical polices are obtained by mixing lower level policies in a similar way to product of experts (Hinton, 2002) or ensemble methods in supervised learning. Using the terminology and notation of Sutton, Precup...</p>

I&#8217;m talking here about the Agent-Environment interaction diagram originally found in Sutton and Barto&#8217;s Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction on page 52 in the third chapter entitled The Reinforcement Learning Problem. I perpetuated the tradition for my Master&#8217;s thesis and used it in the background section. I adapted the figure for Latex using Tikz and made the code snippet available as a Gist on...</p>

      <p>
As part of my Master&#8217;s thesis, I implemented George Konidaris&#8217; Pinball domain for reinforcement Learning.
Konidaris had already made available his original implementation in Java. The environment could also be reached through an RL-Glue socket interface.

Porting it to Python however made the transition to Will Dabney&#8217;s Python-Rl much easier while avoiding the performance bottleneck due socket communication.

And I love working with Python

      <p>In some recent TCP experiment that I carried in the user space, I faced the problem of generating relatively precise timer events in an asynchronous way. Furthermore, multiple timers had to be maintained simultaneously. The timerfd mechanism in Linux (man timerfd_create(2)) allows one to create different types of timers that communicate expiry events through a file descriptor. The standard read(), select(), poll() functions can then be used to detect and process the expiration notifications. As...</p>
