title : The Ubiquitous RL Agent Interaction Diagram in Tikz
---
It is present in almost all of the presentation about Reinforcement Learning.
I'm talking here about the Agent-Environment interaction diagram originally found in Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction](http://www.amazon.ca/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Richard-Sutton/dp/0262193981/) on page 52 in the third chapter entitled *The Reinforcement Learning Problem*.

I perpetuated the tradition for my Master's thesis and used it in the background section.
I adapted the figure for Latex using Tikz and made the code snippet available as a Gist on Github.

It's only while writing these lines that I realized that the original post-script files could be obtained from [Sutton's website](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/figures/figures.html).

There is always room for improvement and you might find better ways of illustrate the RL approach: feel free to hack !
