Unfortunately, according to <https://us.pycon.org/2014/registration/#Tutorial> it seems that each tutorial costs $200. A price which makes sense for companies and self-employed contractors, but not so much for students or general enthusiasts.

Financial aid is offered for the main conference or on a per-tutorial basis: <https://us.pycon.org/2014/assistance/>
