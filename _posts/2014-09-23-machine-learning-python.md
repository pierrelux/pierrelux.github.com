title : An intro to applied machine learning in Python

I wrote this IPython notebook on using Python for applied machine learning.
The material was intended for grad students taking the course [Applied Machine
Learning](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/comp598/) taught by professor Joelle
Pineau.

I tried to cover some of the language interoperability features of IPython and
then focused on model selection and preprocessing under Scikit-learn.
