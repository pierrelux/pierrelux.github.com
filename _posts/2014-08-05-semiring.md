A semiring is a structure $$( K, \oplus, \odot, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1})$$ which satisfies
the following conditions

1. $$(K, \oplus, \mathbf{0})$$ is a commutative monoid in which $$\oplus$$ is an
associative and commutative binary operation for which $$0$$ acts as the
neutral element.
2. $$(K, \odot, \mathbf{1})$$ is a monoid. That is, $$\odot$$ is an associative binary
operation for which $$1$$ is the neutral element.
3. $$\odot$$ is distributive both on the left and on the right over $$\oplus$$. This means that
$$x \odot (y \oplus z) = x \odot y \oplus x \odot z$$ and $$(y \oplus z)\odot x = y \odot x \oplus z \odot x$$
4. $$\mathbf{0}$$ is absorbing for $$\odot$$. An absorbing element is such that $$\mathbf{0} \odot x = x \odot \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}$$

Some common examples of semirings:

* $$(\mathbb{N}, +, \dot, 0, 1)$$ : the set of natural numbers with the usual addition and mulplication
* $$(\mathbb{R}, +, \dot, 0, 1)$$ : the set of real numbers with the usual addition and multiplication
* $$(\{0, 1\}, \land, \lor, 0, 1)$$ : the boolean semiring with $$\lor$$ acting as addition and $$\land$$ as multiplicaiton

Semirings are particularly important when it comes to the study of Weighted Finite state Automata (WFA).
