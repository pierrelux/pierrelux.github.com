title : Do skillful behaviors only exist in the eye of the observer ?
---

I am sometimes calling into question the idea of __skill acquisition__ in its
dominant representationalist view. In AI the idea of skills has been
instantiated under many forms: from the macro-actions in STRIPS-like
frameworks, to the __behaviors__ of the subsumption achitecture, or any of the
various formalisms of hierachical reinforcement learning proposed during the
90s.

For example, in the options framework a skill is a triple of the
form $$\langle \mathcal{I}, \pi, \mathcal{B} \rangle$$: an initiation set
(precondition), policy and termination function (postcondition). From a
practical point of view, this is a convenient way of explaining what it means
to reason over temporally extended actions.

But does it even makes sense to treat skills as representable atomic objects of
the agent-environement interaction ? Should the rational behavior of an agent
be decomposable into elementary skills to truly qualify as a skillfull behavior
?

{% cite Calvin2000 --style apa-intext %} asks (p.112):

Hinting at an answer, he quotes the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam:

> [What] you are describing is not an object but a function, a role that is
> inextricably tied to some context. Take away the context and the meaning also
> disappears...

Ulam goes on arguing that what we perceive is a function but not an object
per se. {% cite Araujo2011 --style apa-intext %} adopt a similar view.
They claim that cognitive and experimental psychology are going through the same
phases as that of other sciences which evolved from the study of the substance
to that of the inherent process. In physics for example, the substance of caloric
heat has eventually been replaced by the process of random kinectic motion.
They argue that such a position necessarily leads to an explanatory regress,
presupposing the existence of a behavior by some pre-existing structures.

The fundamental problem remains to explain why such apparent structures might
appear: "a quest for understanding of causation" {% cite Calvin2000 %} (p. 124).

The class of symbolic models of cognition such as ACT-R {%cite Newell1990 --style apa-intext %}
is well summarized in {%cite Araujo2011 --style apa-intext %}:

>The dominant tendency in deterministic system theorizing is to equate
>knowledge with the acquisition and storage of discrete mental concepts and to
>study the form of these entities along with the inferential processes
>(required for symbol manipulation) that operate upon them.

The tendency towards explaining behavior in terms of personal features rather
than the agent-environment relation is typical of the
representationalist models: a problem of "organismic asymmetry".

The ecological view of skill acquisition attributes the emergence of behavior
both in terms of personal and environmental constraints. For {%cite Araujo2011 --style apa-intext %}, the process of skill acquisition should rather be
described as "skill attenuement" achived by attending to the key properties (affordances) of the
"performance environment" according to the the agent's body and action set.
