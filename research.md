   <p>I am currently working on my master's thesis under the supervision of Professor
   <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/">Doina Precup</a> in the <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca">Reasoning and Learning Laboratory</a>.</p>

   <p>Reinforcement learning has proven to be a powerful approach for solving many sequential
   decision making problems. Robotics lends itself also quite naturally to RL which considers
   the process of acquiring knowledge through the interaction of an agent with its
   environment. My research goal is to create RL-based systems that could leverage the
   knowledge of a robot teacher through demonstrations. More precisely, I'm interested in the problem of
   hierchical subtask decompositions from demonstrations for options learning.</p>

   <p>Given a demonstration, we would want an RL agent to find meaningful subtask boundaries and learn a corresponding
   consistent set of options. </p>

  <h3><a href="assets/papers/optionsdetect.pdf">Automatic Options Discovery</a></h3>
  Based on the bottleneck concept, I proposed a near-linear incremental
  options discovery algorithm based on a label propagation algorithm for
  community detection in networks.

   <h3><a href="assets/papers/hmmskin.pdf">Gesture Recognition</a> <small>for an Artificial Skin</small></h3>
   An HMM-based algorithm for detecting tactile patterns on a novel type
   of artificial skin sensor manufactured by Meka Robotics LLC was designed.

     </ul>-->

   Head pose is a rich visual cue that finds great interest
   in the field of human robot interaction (HRI) and for video
   surveillance applications. I proposed a regression solution to
   head pose estimation based on random regression forests
   trained over SURF features.
